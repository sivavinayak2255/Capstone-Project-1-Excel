#Capstone Project 1 Excel<br/>
I worked on real-time case studies requiring advanced data analysis in MS Excel to ensure accurate business insights.<br/>

My goal was to apply advanced Excel functions and formulas to solve real-world business problems with high accuracy. Additionally, I visualized Freshco Hypermarket’s real-time data, creating logical metrics using Pivot Tables, charts, and diagrams.<br/>

I utilized advanced Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, IF, SUMIFS, and conditional formatting to clean, analyze, and process large datasets efficiently. I also leveraged Pivot Tables and dynamic charts to generate meaningful visual representations and insights.<br/>

Achieved 100% accuracy in solving case studies using Excel functions and formulas. Additionally, successfully visualized Freshco Hypermarket’s data, creating logical metrics with Pivot Tables and charts with 95% accuracy, leading to better decision-making insights.<br/>
